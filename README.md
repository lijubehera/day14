**#Day14 of My Python Learning Journey â€” Practicing with Tuples in Python**

Today I focused on strengthening my basics with some beginner-friendly **tuple questions** in Python. Tuples are a fundamental data structure â€” simple, yet powerful when it comes to storing fixed, ordered data.

Here are some of the questions I solved:

âœ… **Basic Tuple Practice Questions:**

1. Create a tuple of 5 numbers and print it.
   *Example: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)*

2. Access the **second element** of the tuple.

3. Find the **length** of the tuple.

4. Check if the **number 10** is in the tuple.

5. Print all elements using a **for loop**.

6. Try to **change the first element** of the tuple â€” observe what happens!
   *(Hint: Tuples are immutable.)*

7. **Concatenate two tuples.**
   *Example: (1, 2) + (3, 4) â†’ (1, 2, 3, 4)*

8. Create a **tuple with one item** and print its type.
   *(Hint: Use `(10,)` not `(10)` â€” there's a difference!)*

9. Count how many times a number appears in a tuple.

10. Find the **index** of a specific element in a tuple.

ðŸ§  **Key Takeaway:**
Tuples are immutable and lightweight, which makes them great for storing data that should never be changed. Practicing these small questions helps solidify how tuples behave compared to other data types like lists.
